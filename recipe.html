      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the leaves:</strong> Boil the bitterleaf in plain
          water for 10–15 minutes to soften and reduce bitterness. Avoid potash
          if possible, but if used, rinse thoroughly afterward.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Parboil the cow head with 2 seasoning
          cubes, salt, and chopped onions for 10 minutes. Then add water and
          cook until tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add fish:</strong> Wash dry fish and stockfish with hot water,
          then add to the pot. Cook until tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flavor the broth:</strong> Add palm oil, ground crayfish,
          pepper, remaining seasoning, salt, and ogiri. Stir well and simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Thicken the soup:</strong> Add pounded cocoyam (or egusi if
          desired) and cook until dissolved. Add ofor if more thickness is
          needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Final touch:</strong> Add the bitterleaf, stir, adjust
          seasoning, and cook for 2–3 more minutes.
        </li>
      </ol>
